# Predicting Wine Quality with Gradient Descent

by Michael Robertson and Alex Angus for Davidson College's Machine Learning Homework 1

---

In this project we demonstrate and analyze a regression model for predicting the quality of wines. Specifically, we will be using gradient descent to forecast the quality rating that a human critic would give a wine.


Please run Predicting_Wine_Quality_with_Gradient_Descent.ipynb with a Jupyter notebook for an interactive demonstration of our project.
